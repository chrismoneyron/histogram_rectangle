				The challenge of finding the largest continuous rectangle in 
				a histogram is very interesting. There are so many different ways
				of solving a problem like this. Therefore, this site displays
				two different ways of solving it.
			</p>
			<p class = "intro_paragraph">
				The first method uses a brute force tactic by finding every
				single continuous rectangle in the histogram and determining
				which of these is the maximum area. Although this works, 
				it's time complexity would be around O(n^2) which is not very
				efficient.
			</p>
			<p class = "intro_paragraph">
				Therefore, the other method, which uses a two-dimensional sort,
				is the better approach to this problem. It's time complexity
				is O(n) which is very efficient. Please feel free to try 
				your problems with both methods!
